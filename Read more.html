    <h2 class="read0">The Patient With Brain Tumour</h2>
    <p class="read">
        I had been suffering from headaches for several years. Around nine years ago I started to change, I became fixated on work but as I was so busy, I just carried on, unaware that these changes in my personality and the way I was working were a symptom of something more serious.

In June 2021 I tested positive for Covid, at first, I had no symptoms, however, two days in I had what I can only describe as an explosion in my head. The pressure was horrendous, and my head felt like it was in a vice.

This continued for several weeks so I contacted my GP, as I thought I may have long Covid. I had lost strength in my right arm, was struggling to lift it over my head and couldn’t clench my fist properly.

My GP sent me for an urgent CT scan. Two weeks later I was told, over the phone, as Covid had stopped face to face appointments, that I had a brain tumour.

I was absolutely devastated and the news completely floored me. I had gone in a split second from a hard-working guy with my whole future mapped out to realising very quickly that life would never be the same again for me, or my family.

I was told by the specialist, that due to the size of the tumour (as big as a satsuma), the only treatment available to me was emergency surgery, which would be risky due to the location of the tumour, and if I survived the operation, the recovery would be long, and it was likely I would have ongoing issues.

The initial date for my surgery saw me being sent home from hospital due to a lack of critical care beds, so it was rescheduled for 16 September 2021. Due to the levels of Covid in the hospital, I wasn’t allowed visitors and had to say goodbye to my wife in the waiting room, which was hard.

Despite some complications, surgery went well. The tumour had wrapped itself around the main vein in my brain and during the procedure I had substantial blood loss, this meant they didn’t manage to remove it all. The biopsy showed that the tumour was a grade 1 meningioma and because there was only a small bit left behind, other treatment options would be available if the tumour began to grow in the future.

I was sent home quite quickly, and received care at home, mainly from my wife, being in familiar surroundings with my family around me and being in sole control of the TV remote, helped my recovery .

I was told that I’d had the tumour for between nine to 15 years and if left much longer wrapped around the vein, I was only months if not weeks away from collapse.

I know I am very fortunate to get a second chance of life, I had a close call and am one of the very few people that can say Covid actually saved me.

    <h2 class="read0">The Syptoms Of Brain Tumour</h2>
    <p class="read2">I felt it was important to share my story, to raise awareness and encourage others, who may be presenting with similar symptoms, to seek help and advice as early as possible from their GP.

        Looking back, a number of things now make sense, and I realise I had been displaying symptoms for some time:<br>
        
           (1) I had headaches a number of times a week. These would occur most days and sometimes last all day despite taking painkillers.
           (2) I felt tired but still struggled to sleep.<br>
           (3) My personality changed as well. I became fixated on things like work. I was always working and had to get involved in every investigation.<br>
           (4) I would flit from one thing to another. I would often rant in emails.<br>
           (5) I had pins and needles in my thigh which I used to put down to nerve damage following an earlier injury.<br>
           (6) I gained a large amount of weight and had problems with my vision. I was initially diagnosed with type two diabetes.<br>
           (7) My blood pressure was high. All this was put down to stress at work, poor health, and poor work life balance.
